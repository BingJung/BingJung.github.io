            Hallo! I'm a senior undergraduate student from <a href="https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en/college">ZJU-UIUC Institute</a>, advised by <a href="http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu">Prof. Jiawei Han</a> and <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/miaoxy_en">Prof. Xiaoye Miao</a> while majoring in Computer Engineering. I have been interested in <b>representation learning</b> on data in various structures and modalities, and I'm currently struggling to survive from my senior designs advised by <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/shuruntan">Prof. Shurun Tan</a>, <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/ylj">Prof. Liangjing Yang</a>, and <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/gaoangwang">Prof. Gaoang Wang</a> about <b>multimodal sensing</b> and <b>long-horizon task completion</b>.
            <br><br>
            In the future, I hope machines can form divergent hierarchical structures in their mind to help reasoning, just like how we are forming abstractions in our mind, in order to significantly improve their ability to generalize<!-- <span class="whisper">(while I'm kinda skeptical about can human really "generalize")</span>-->. I also believe the existing systems can no longer satisfy our modeling of intelligence with such capability :P. Eventually I wish to <!-- would be helping improve the mode of production and education for the broad society with reliable, general, and interpretable artificial intelligence--> rid my mom of her housework as well as rid my little brother of his homework with my research. Below are several sections in which <b>titles are links</b>. Feel free to explore them! More about me will be updated soon <span class="whisper">hopefully</span>.

            Here I'm going to introduce courses that I have taken following several critical disciplines. I will also demonstrate how they inspired me with brand-new viewpoints to inspect the world, as well as how I feel about my participation in these courses. <span class="whisper">Hopefully this page won't be caught by the professors.</span>

        <p>Rousseau made his confessions, which has been imitated by many people later on. However, as I am neither that evil nor that pessimistic, I would rather like to share my gratitude here to those who has endured the imperfect me(s) and guided me towards where I am.</p>
