        <h2>About Statistics</h2>
        Regarding the relation between ML and statistics, we should probably distinguish empiricism from statistics. ML is empiricism, which states merely the reliance on experiences, while could make use of them in more sophiscated manners.

            It's indeed super impressive for current language models to capture grammar and possibly concepts so well. However, grammar is a finite set of rules, while what're even more charming can be the infinite possibilities behind reasoning.

            Basically we are all trading for living necessities with particular parts of our body, most of which will withstand wear or tear for use.

            Obviously I didn't see that every work requires a brain, but it still makes sense on the perspective of wear versus polishment. They are like bases being below and above one in an exponential function. Theoritically if ones start with wearing themselves for living at the very begining, they will never get the chance to excape. However, things will get more interesting if AI gets involved, for both those're embodied and those not.
